# Day-Planner
This is a simple calendare application that allows user to save event for each hour of the day. This app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). 

After entering an event and click save button, the entry gets stored in the localStorage so the user entry will be still present when the browswer get closed/refreshed.

Also the application displays the current time and also dynamically color codes the each hour to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This changes depending on the time of the day.
