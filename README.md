# Day-Planner
This is a simple calendar application that allows user to save event for each hour of the day. This app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). 

After entering an event and clicking save button, the user's entry gets stored in the localStorage so it will not get lost when the broswer gets closed or refreshed.

Also the application displays the current time and dynamically color codes the each hour to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, in the present, or in the future. This changes depending on the time of the day.
